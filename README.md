# Hi there âœ¨

I'm Santiago Rodriguez from  Colombia, and I do content Development. I really enjoy languages and frameworks like Python Native, as well as work in WordPress.
I also enjoy wireframing, ui, ux, and design in general. You can check out my Linkedln at https://www.linkedin.com/in/santiago-esteban-rodr%C3%ADguez-guti%C3%A9rrez-723106225 .
